hello buddy
can you build me an hello world c++ program in this folder

sylvia@sylvia-Latitude-5320:~/Documents/C_Plus_Plus_Projects$

coz this is where i will put all my c++ programs
even folders i will clone from github later

you should also configure in there an .vscode folder responsible to execute c++ programs no matter the name
coz i do not want to create for each program his .vscode folder , no, but instead they will share the same .vscode responsible to handle c++ programs executions with g++
i want you also to make sure that the g++ is installed and if not install it for me
and at the end execute tha helloworld program like this to verify if it workes

g++ -c helloworld.cpp
g++ -o helloworld helloworld.o
./helloworld

i use Ubuntu as OS
